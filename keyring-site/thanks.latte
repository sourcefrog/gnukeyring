  {\h2 thanks}

I borrowed Bill Clagett's Makefile structure for internationalized
resources.

Stefan H. Holek contributed the first translation of the
resources, into German.  

Juan Carlos Borrás contributed the Spanish translation.

Thanks also to all the users who've sent notes of encouragement, and
to the people who wrote the tools on which this builds.
