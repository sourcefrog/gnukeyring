Keyring for PalmOS lets you securely store secret keys and
confidential information on a PalmOS handheld computer.  This
information might include: computer account passwords, credit card
numbers, GnuPG or PGP passphrases, SKey one-time-pads, or phone
banking keywords.

Keyring for PalmOS is Free Software, so you can inspect it to satisfy
yourself of its security, modify it to meet your needs, and share it
with your friends.

Records are encrypted using the well-trusted DES3 algorithm on a
master password.  For your convenience, the keyring can stay unlocked
for a time after you enter your master password.  You can configure
this behaviour through the "Preferences" command.  Keyring for PalmOS
attempts to overwrite memory containing sensitive data after use.

When you need to set a password, Keyring for PalmOS can generate a
random password of specified length, optionally including letters,
numbers or symbols.
