keyring-link
------------

This is a prototype desktop interface to the Keyring for PalmOS
database.  At the moment, the only implemented function is dumping all
records in text form.

To build this, you will need the libpisock library (sometimes called
pilot-link-devel), and OpenSSL.  This is tested on Debian `Woody'
GNU/Linux, but ought to work elsewhere.

To use it, transfer the Keys-Gtkr.PDB file to your PC, and invoke the
`keyring' app as 

  keyring-link PDBFILE [PASSWORD]
