      I wonder if you should be prompted for a password before being
      allowed into the database?

    <p>
      Some people have suggested allowing a backup question for people
      to use when they forget their passphrase.  Here's how it would
      work:

      <ol>
      <li>People give the program their question, such as ``my
	mother's middle name'', and the answer ``Gertrude''.

      <li>
	Keyring encrypts a spare copy of the session key with the
	answer, and stores the encrypted session key and the question
	in a spare record.

      <li>
        If the person forgets their password, then they can ask to see
        the prompting question, and they get the chance to enter the
        the answer.

      <li>
        If they enter the answer correctly, the session key is
        unlocked and they can edit the records and change the real
        passphrase.
      </ol>
    </p>
