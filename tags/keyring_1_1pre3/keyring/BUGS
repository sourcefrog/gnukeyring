* Crashes when paging out of a record whose name has been changed.
"crypto.c: not block padded".  

This leaves a corrupted record whose name begins with "XXXXX",
indicating that the problem might be something to do with
obliteration.

The problem seems to occur when pressing Down from the last record.

* Crash on leaving the edit form after editing, with "resizing record"
  dialog. 

* Need to run under POSE!
