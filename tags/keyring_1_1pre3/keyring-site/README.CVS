This CVS module, `site', contains the rproxy web site.  Changes are
manually uploaded to the web server.  You only need this module if you
want to submit changes to the site.

This site is built using the great Latte <http://latte.org/> tool,
which is some kind of combination of TeX, Scheme, and HTML.  See if
you like it.
