GNU Keyring 0.13.0 preview release 2

This is a PREVIEW version of GNU Keyring 0.13, which includes a major
rewrite of the database layers to fix the `resizing record', `chunk
locked' and `restore from backup' bugs.

It does *NOT* know how to convert existing databases, and the database
format will likely change again before the real release.  However, I
would really like to hear feedback on whether you can reproduce any
bugs or crashes in this version of the program.  If you run it on a
real handheld rather than an emulator, make triply sure you back up
your existing data.

Changes since 0.13.0pr1:

 * Memory and database bugs fixed.

 * Slightly enhanced Generate Password dialog.

 * Uses a table control rather than a list for the main view.  Looks
   nicer.

 * Add Record/UndoAll menu item.

 * Records without names are now displayed with an index number rather
   than random hex.

 * Stay unlocked for the full timeout value, even if you switch to
   another app and back.

 * Garbage record does not appear when you change the password.

 * Records are actually encrypted.

To do before 0.13:

 * Convert from old database format

 * Fix misbehaviour when changing record categories

 * -- Your bugs go here! --
