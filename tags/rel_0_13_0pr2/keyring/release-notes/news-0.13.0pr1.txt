GNU Keyring 0.13.0 preview release 1

  2000-09-13
  ftp://gnukeyring.sourceforge.net/pub/gnukeyring/preview/

This is a PREVIEW version of GNU Keyring 0.13, which includes a major
rewrite of the database layers to fix the `resizing record', `chunk
locked' and `restore from backup' bugs.

It does *NOT* know how to convert existing databases, and the database
format will likely change again before the real release.  However, I
would really like to hear feedback on whether you can reproduce any
bugs or crashes in this version of the program.  If you run it on a
real handheld rather than an emulator, make triply sure you back up
your existing data.

Here are the changes in this release:

 * Forward-compatible change to use database version 2, which supports
   categories and doesn't lose the encryption key in backups :-/

 * A cleaner dialog to set the master password, including dialog help.

 * Improved About box (!), including the home page URL.

 * Keyring now checks the PalmOS ROM feature set at startup, and if it
   can't run it says so right away.

 * If this is an unstable release of GNU Keyring, then display a
   warning at startup.

 * Add in sprinklings of memory validation

 * Add Record/UndoAll menu item.

 * Improved record export.

 * Records without names are now displayed with an index number rather
   than random hex.
