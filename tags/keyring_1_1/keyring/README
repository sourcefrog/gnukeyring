Keyring for PalmOS
Copyright (C) 1999-2002 by Martin Pool <mbp@users.sourceforge.net> and others.

Keyring lets you securely store secret keys and confidential
information on a PalmOS handheld computer.  This information might
include: computer account passwords, credit card numbers, GnuPG or PGP
passphrases, SKey one-time-pads, or phone banking keywords.

Keyring is Free Software, so you can inspect it to satisfy
yourself of its security, modify it to meet your needs, and share it
with your friends.

Records are encrypted using the well-trusted DES3 algorithm on a
master password.  For your convenience, the keyring can stay unlocked
for a time after you enter your master password.  You can configure
this behaviour through the "Preferences" command.  Keyring
attempts to overwrite memory containing sensitive data after use.

When you need to set a password, Keyring can generate a random
password of specified length, optionally including letters, numbers or
symbols.
