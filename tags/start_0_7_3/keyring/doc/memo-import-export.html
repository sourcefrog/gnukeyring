    <h1>Import/Export of Memos</h1>

    <p><tt>$Id$</tt></p>

    
    <p>It might be nice if GNU Keyring gained the ability to import data from 
      and export it to the PalmOS Memo Pad.

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Without Keyring, people tend to store their secret data in
      the memo pad -- I certainly did.

      <li>The memo pad provides a reasonably accessible way to enter
      data on the PC.
    </ul>

    <p>I'm not sure if this is really useful, but it merits
    consideration. 


      
    <h2>Import</h2>

    <p>To import data, the user should choose either a whole category
      of Memo Pad records or a single record.  (Is doing one record at
      a time sufficient?)  This should be invoked from a menu command
      in the list form, which shows a dialog listing the first line of
      all memos.  

    <p>For each record, we create a new record in
      the Keyring, having a name equal to the first line of the memo,
      and the notes field equal to the rest.

    <p>On completion we should leave the user in the new record so
      that they can tidy it up or at least see that it has been
      completed.


      
    <h2>Export</h2>

    <p>Similarly, for each exported record, create a new memo
    containing on successive lines all non-null fields from the key.
    This should be invoked from the menu in the Record form, and
    should ask which category will receive the exported record.


    <h2>Technicalities</h2>

    <p>We need to understand the category format and the record format
      for the memo pad, but they're pretty trivial: records are just
      nul-terminated strings.
