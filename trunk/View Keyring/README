                                        View Keyring

This is a viewer application for Keyring files on Mac OS X, written by
Chris Ridd <chrisridd@mac.com> and contributed to the Keyring for
PalmOS project under the BSD license.

Build requirements
------------------
Nothing unusual should be required, as by default everything uses
standard stuff that Apple always ship.

However if you change DataAdditions.m so that USING_CDSA is undefined,
the code will try to use an OpenSSL library shipped by Apple. (CDSA is
the name of the open source cryptographic library in Apple's Security
framework, and by default View Keyring will use that.)

Unfortunately Apple only started shipping the OpenSSL header files in
Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar), so this makes building View Keyring a bit more
difficult if you're still on 10.1. The OS X boxes in Sourceforge's
"Compile Farm" are still running 10.1.

If you don't have the OpenSSL headers, then just grab a tarball of the
appropriate OpenSSL version from <http://www.openssl.org/> and extract
it. Add the path to the OpenSSL headers to the C compiler settings in
the View Keyring project.

You will also need to add /usr/lib/libcrypto.dylib to the project's
Frameworks.

That's roughly how to do it anyway, since I haven't had 10.1 for quite
a while now my memory's a bit rusty on the details!

Build instructions
------------------
From the Project Builder GUI, just click the hammer icon or type
Command-B. Easy :-)

If you're using the command-line then you can do an "install" (to a
mounted disk image, perhaps) as well.

% cd "View Keyring"
% hdiutil create -sectors 10240 -layout NONE -fs HFS+ \
    -volname "View Keyring" /tmp/vktmp.dmg
% hdid /tmp/vktmp.dmg
(note the device it mounts using, disk4 in this case)
% pbxbuild install -buildstyle Deployment "DSTROOT=/Volumes/View Keyring"
% hdiutil detach disk4
% hdiutil convert -format UDZO -o /tmp/vk.dmg /tmp/vktmp.dmg
% hdiutil internet-enable /tmp/vk.dmg

If you're using OpenSSL (see above) the linker warns about a multiply
defined symbol (_crypt) being present in the OpenSSL crypto library and
the standard library. Ignore it, as View Keyring doesn't use that
function anyway.

Bugs
----
There probably are bugs in the app :-( In particular I haven't done
any testing of the Japanese character conversion stuff using Japanese
characters (using 7-bit ASCII it seems to work OK), so please report
back if you've got a Japanese Palm!

Please use Sourceforge to log any bug reports/enhancement requests.

Future
------
Obviously it would be nice to use View Keyring to make modifications
to the keyring file.

What would be even better IMO would be to have a real conduit that
synchronized changes on the Palm to an Apple keychain. I'm working on
a conduit for Missing Sync, however it will not work with the old Palm
Hotsync Manager due to Palm not supporting Mach-O.
