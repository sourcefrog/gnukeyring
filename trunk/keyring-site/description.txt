Keyring for PalmOS lets you securely store secret keys and
confidential information on a PalmOS handheld computer.  This
information might include: computer account passwords, credit card
numbers, GnuPG or PGP passphrases, SKey one-time-pads, or phone
banking keywords.

Keyring is Free Software, so you can inspect it to satisfy yourself of
its security, modify it to meet your needs, and share it with your
friends.

Records are encrypted using the well-trusted DES3 algorithm on a
master password.  For your convenience, the keyring can stay unlocked
for a time after you enter your master password.

When you need to set a password, Keyring can generate a random
password of specified length, optionally including letters, numbers or
symbols.
