Keyring for PalmOS 1.1 preview 3
(previously GNU Keyring)

Keyring for PalmOS lets you securely store secret keys and
confidential information on a PalmOS handheld computer.  This
information might include: computer account passwords, credit card
numbers, GnuPG or PGP passphrases, SKey one-time-pads, or phone
banking keywords.

Keyring is Free Software, so you can inspect it to satisfy yourself of
its security, modify it to meet your needs, and share it with your
friends.

Records are encrypted using the well-trusted DES3 algorithm on a
master password.  For your convenience, the keyring can stay unlocked
for a time after you enter your master password.

When you need to set a password, Keyring can generate a random
password of specified length, optionally including letters, numbers or
symbols.

Changes from 1.0:

 * Renamed project from "GNU Keyring" to "Keyring for PalmOS".

 * Added an entropy pool contributed by Jochen Hoenicke
   <https://sf.net/users/hoenicke>, based on the Linux entropy device.
   This makes generated password harder to predict.

 * Ship a tar files containing the sources and a zip files containing
   all binaries.  I hope the zip file will reduce the incidence of
   people confused by truncated downloads.

 * Encryption keys are now stored on the heap, not in a temporary
   database, and are obliterated after use.  The encryption key is
   destroyed after the timeout elapses, and not on the next
   action.  Patch from Jochen Hoenicke.

 * Before the Palm enteres sleep mode, it returns from the edit
   form to the list form.  Patches from Mustafa Kocaturk
   <https://sf.net/users/mkocaturk> and Jochen Hoenicke.

 * Add a lock bitmap to display the state of the database.  Pressing
   it will lock the database immediately.

 * The master key can now be veiled when the data base unlocked.

 * Translations for Dutch, French, Norwegian, Italian and Japanese.

 * Login and Passwords are displayed in a special font to distinguish
   I and l.
