Download and unpack the zip file directly from the sourceforge
download page.  The zip file contains several Palm program files, the
base keyring program and various cryptographic libraries.

Install the base application and the appropriate overlay using your
Palm Desktop or pilot-link software.  Also install DESLib.prc or
AESlib.prc or both.  When upgrading from a previous release (NOT YET
SUPPORTED FOR PRERELEASES) you also need MDLib.prc.

Under Linux, amongst other programs, you can use the Pilot-Link
package.  After installing and configuring that package, use a command
like:

  $ pilot-link -i keyring-1.1-en.prc MDLib.prc DESLib.prc

to install the applications.
