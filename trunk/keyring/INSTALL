Download and unpack the zip file directly from the sourceforge
download page.  The zip file contains several Palm program files, the
base keyring program and various cryptographic libraries.

Install the base application and the appropriate overlay using your Palm
Desktop or pilot-link software.  Also install DESLib.prc or AESlib.prc or
both.  When upgrading from a previous release you also need MDLib.prc 
(you should have it already installed).

Under Linux, amongst other programs, you can use the Pilot-Link
package.  After installing and configuring that package, use a command
like:

  $ pilot-xfer -i keyring-2.0-en.prc AESLib.prc DESLib.prc

to install the applications.
