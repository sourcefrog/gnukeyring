Installing GNU Keyring for PalmOS
Copyright (C) 1999, 2000, 2001 by Martin Pool <mbp@users.sourceforge.net>

Download and unpack the tar or zip file.  They contain four Palm
program files, one for each of the supported languages:

  de	German
  es	Spanish
  en    English
  sv    Swedish

Install the appropriate application using your Palm Desktop or
pilot-link software.

Under Linux, amongst other programs, you can use the Pilot-Link
package.  After installing and configuring that package, use a command
like:

  $ pilot-link -i keyring-1.1-en.prc

to install the application.
