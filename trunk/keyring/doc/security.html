<h1>Access to keyring data on the PC</h1>
<p>What shall we do about access to this data on the PC?  The essential
difficulty is this: I want to be able to use a PC for data entry and
lookup, because it has a higher-bandwidth user interface than a
handheld; but PCs are also much more vulnerable than hand-held
computers: they may have several users, offer network services or at
least have a network connection, and have a much more complicated
software environment.

<p>In short, I don't think I'd be comfortable leaving the password to
a system I care about on most PCs, and I'd be even less comfortable to
leave my personal financial details.  It seems safer to leave them on
the handheld, though far from completely safe.

<p>This all has useful applications outside of GNU Keyring because 

  <ul>
    <li>A huge number of small computers will be deployed over the
    next decade

    <li>Most will be networked
 
    <li>Most will interact with security systems as wallets, 
        network-billing-points, 

    <li>The basic ideas about trust, 

  </ul>

<p>From the <a href="attack-tree.html">attack tree analysis</a>, it
looks like the top few weaknesses are:

  <ul>
    <p><li><b>Short master password is broken by brute force</b>

	<p>Basically most of the security of the security of the
	system resides in the master key.  Can we make this a bit
	harder in any way?
       
    <p><li><b>Trojan on handheld leaks data</b>

        <p>The trojan could be included in a program the user
        explicitly downloads and installs, or it could be inserted
        into their PC, or it could be installed in some other way.  A
        simple example would be releasing a copy of the keyring
        software that has encryption disabled or weakened.

        <p>The most obvious way to return information to the attacker
        would be to try to use the handheld's network library.
        Another more subtle alternative would be to just weaken the
        encryption and to have the attacker retrieve and break the
        backup database.

  </ul>

<p>Precautions:

  <ul>

  <li>Only sync with trusted machines.  Your assessment of trust here
  ought to include: 
    <ul>
      <li>Physical security
      <li>Network protection (firewalled?  remote logins allowed? running many services?)
      <li>Who has root on the machine?  Do you trust them?
      <li>Who has an account?
      <li>Is the software trustworthy: up-to-date, and a reliable system?
    </ul>

  <li>Only install trusted software on the handheld.

  <li>Best of all is to keep the information in your head, or at least
  part of it.  For example scrambling the password in some way before
  storing it (e.g. recording it backwards) would help a little.  

  <p>Whether this will do depends on how much entropy is in the secret
  and how often you use it, which together determine how hard it is to
  remember.

  <li>There's also a lot to be said for secure physical storage,
  e.g. keeping (part of) your master secret-key passphrase under your
  mattress.  Many people prepared to break into your computer across
  the network would not break into your house; and vice versa. 

  <p>This depends on the secret: SSH passphrases are likely more
  interesting to network attackers; credit card numbers to burglars.

  </ul>

<p>It would be nice if PCs universally had IR ports: we could use that
as a convenient method to transfer authentication data from the
handheld to the PC.
