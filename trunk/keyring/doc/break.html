      <a href=".">GNU Keyring</a> tries to keep your passwords secure
      through it's user interface and storage.  One important feature
      of this is that passwords are encrypted when stored in the
      database and PC.  </p>

    <p>
      The EDE DES3 algorithm used to do this is well trusted, but a
      fundamental limit is the length of the master key.  To achieve
      the full potential of the encryption algorithm, the master key
      would have to have 112 bits of entropy.  Assuming a good mix of
      letters and other symbols, each character would contribute a bit
      over 6 bits of entropy.  Therefore passwords over 18 characters
      are maximally secure, while anything under that is
      proportionally more vulnerable to a brute-force attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the password has to be entered each time the keyring is
      accessed I expect few people will use 18 character passwords.  A
      more likely password of six randomly-selected printable
      characters gives about 40 bits of entropy, which is about a
      million million possible passwords.  This is reasonably large,
      but not impossible to check by brute force on a modern PC.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's no way that I know of to keep useful secrets on the
      handheld, and in any case keeping things there would prevent
      backing up the keyring and put it at risk of loss from hardware
      failure, battery exhaustion or pilot error.
    </p>

    <p>
      Changing to a new encryption algorithm would not help the
      essential problem of predictable keys.  One option would be to
      use something other than an alphanumeric password.  Perhaps a
      freehand signature could be used to form a digital secret key?
    </p>

    <p>
      Since it's probably possible to brute force the password, the
      most useful precaution is to only backup the keyring to a
      trusted PC.  Some criteria for security to weigh against the
      confidentiality of the data in the keyring include:

    <ul>
      <li>The operating system and services on the machine should be
	up-to-date; and new fixes should be promptly applied as
	problems are found.

      <li>Only people you trust with the information in the keyring
	should have access to the machine.

      <li>The machine should be physically secure.

      <li>Backups of the machine should be made in a secure way and
	kept safe.

      <li>The machine should not be unduly network-accessible.

      <li>Whether the software on the machine can be

    </ul>

    <p>
      I intend in the future to offer a utility to break keyrings on a
      PC as an aid to people who've lost their password.  It's not
      terribly hard to write such a thing, so I can't assume me not
      writing it would give any additional protection.  I'm not sure
      if I'll do this; please
