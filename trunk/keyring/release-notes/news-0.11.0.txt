Changes in 0.11.0:

Allow beaming of the Keyring app without the `a newer version exists'
warning, and without overwriting the existing database.

Add category support, behaving as in the standard Palm apps.

Forward-compatible change to use database version 1, to allow us to
use categories.

Better error reporting.  Sound in some conditions where it should
occur.
