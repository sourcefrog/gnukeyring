GNU Keyring
Changes from 0.11 to 0.13

 * Use a table control rather than a list control for the list of
   keys: better performance and scrolling.

 * Forward-compatible change to use database version 2, which supports
   categories and doesn't lose the encryption key in backups :-/

 * A cleaner dialog to set the master password, including dialog help.

 * Improved About box (!), including the home page URL.

 * Keyring now checks the PalmOS ROM feature set at startup, and if it
   can't run it says so right away.

 * If this is an unstable release of GNU Keyring, then display a
   warning at startup.

 * Add in sprinklings of memory validation.

 * Add Record/UndoAll menu item

 * Improved record export.

 * Records without names are now displayed with an index number rather
   than random hex.

 * Stay unlocked for the full timeout value, even if you switch to
   another app and back.
