GNU Keyring for PalmOS

  Preview release 0.11.1pr1
  25 September 2000

  http://linuxcare.com.au/projects/gnukeyring/preview/0.11.1pr1/

The point of this release is to fix the bug that prevents restoring
databases from backup on some versions of PalmOS.

This is a preview release: if you have had to restore from backup and
are now unable to access your data, then please try this version and
*send feedback if it works*, so that we can make a general release.

To recover from a backup database:

 1. Install this version of GNU Keyring

 2. Restore the Keys-Gtkr database from backup

 3. Enter the application, and choose "Set Password"

 4. Write your old password.  Wrong passwords cannot be detected --
    they will just result in scrambled records.

 5. Click "OK", then set a new password.

 6. Use the database as usual.

If you enter the wrong password, restore from backup and try again.

This is not a complete fix for the backup bug, but it will let you
recover your data.  A proper fix, along with many other improvements,
is coming shortly in version 0.13.

Other changes in 0.11 compared to 0.9:

 * Allows beaming of the Keyring app without the `a newer version
   exists' warning, and without overwriting the existing database.

 * Add category support, behaving as in the standard Palm apps.

 * Forward-compatible change to use database version 1, to allow us to
   use categories.

 * Better error reporting.  Sound in some conditions where it should
   occur.
