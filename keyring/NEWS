Keyring for PalmOS lets you securely store secret keys and
confidential information on a PalmOS handheld computer.  This
information might include: computer account passwords, credit card
numbers, GnuPG or PGP passphrases, SKey one-time-pads, or phone
banking keywords.

Keyring is Free Software, so you can inspect it to satisfy yourself of
its security, modify it to meet your needs, and share it with your
friends.

Records are encrypted using the well-trusted DES3 algorithm on a
master password.  For your convenience, the keyring can stay unlocked
for a time after you enter your master password.

When you need to set a password, Keyring can generate a random
password of specified length, optionally including letters, numbers or
symbols.

Changes from 1.2.1:

 * Fixed selecting an entry from the search form under Palm OS 5.0.

Changes from 1.2:

 * Fixed the serious "freeze on install" bug.

Changes from 1.1:

 * Support PalmOS global Find.

 * Support pronounceable passwords conforming to the FIPS 181
   Automated Password Generator Standard

 * Support interactive search for a key name on list form.

 * Keyedit form is left on auto off if the timeout has also expired.
   Code works for all supported PalmOS versions.

 * Use pilotSSLeay for encryption, which is a bit faster than 
   the PalmOS builtin encryption.  The binaries from
   pilotSSLeay are included.

 * The last-modified-date is back again.

 * Support larger notes, up to 32000 characters.
