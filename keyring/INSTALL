Installing GNU Keyring for PalmOS
Copyright (C) 1999-2002 by Martin Pool <mbp@users.sourceforge.net> and others.

Download and unpack the prc files directly from the sourceforge download
page.  There are several Palm program files, one for each of the supported 
languages:

  de	German
  en	English
  es	Spanish
  fr	French
  it	Italian
  ja	Japanese
  no	Norwegian
  no_NY Norwegian (nynorsk)
  pt	Portuguese
  sv	Swedish

Install the appropriate application using your Palm Desktop or
pilot-link software.

Under Linux, amongst other programs, you can use the Pilot-Link
package.  After installing and configuring that package, use a command
like:

  $ pilot-link -i keyring-1.1-en.prc

to install the application.
