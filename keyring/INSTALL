Installing GNU Keyring for PalmOS

Copyright 1999-2002 The GNU Keyring Sourceforge Team

  http://gnukeyring.sourceforge.net/

Download and unpack the zip file directly from the sourceforge
download page.  The zip file contains several Palm program files, the
base one and one overlay for each of the supported languages:

  deDE	German
  esES	Spanish
  frFR	French
  itIT	Italian
  jpJP	Japanese
  noNO	Norwegian
  ptBR	Portuguese
  svSE	Swedish

Install the base application and the appropriate overlay using your
Palm Desktop or pilot-link software.  Also install MDLib.prc and
DESLib.prc.

Under Linux, amongst other programs, you can use the Pilot-Link
package.  After installing and configuring that package, use a command
like:

  $ pilot-link -i keyring-1.1-en.prc MDLib.prc DESLib.prc

to install the application.
