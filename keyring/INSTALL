Download and unpack the zip file directly from the sourceforge
download page.  The zip file contains several Palm program files, the
one containing the keyring binaries and some crypto libraries.

Install the base application and the libraries MDLib.prc and
DESLib.prc using your Palm Desktop or pilot-link software.

Under Linux, amongst other programs, you can use the Pilot-Link
package.  After installing and configuring that package, use a command
like:

  $ pilot-link -i keyring-1.1-en.prc MDLib.prc DESLib.prc

to install the application.
