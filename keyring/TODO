* Advise use of accented characters as they're much harder to guess.

* Lock the database when the timeout expires, even if it's currently
  showing a record.  Also, make sure changes to the system clock
  cannot cause the keyring to unlock again.  Also, make sure that the
  Snib database is overwritten and unlinked when we lock.

* Strong randomness

* Don't use private records, because they're deleted when the system
  password is reset.

* Choose fonts

* Scroll to show newly-inserted items

* Export using localized field headings

or perhaps don't export them at all.

* Advice on secure passwords

minimum length; use of accented/extended characters

* Must unlock to set prefs

* Update pos when changing categories

* Lock on power off/switching apps

* Move to right record on empty record & page down

* No session key

* Newline in single-line fields should move down one field

* Choose fonts

* Text entry slow?

* Generate button when setting master password?

* Beaming

* Distinguish I from l

* Change back to encrypting using the hash of the password

* Safe way to change password and re-encrypt

* Perhaps use the SSLeay-Palm port?

* Markov chain generation

Generating a state table from a large amount of English text shows
about 4900 three-character states occurred from the 19000 possible,
which sounds about right.  We saw 252000 total transitions, so it
should be quite balanced.

To store this we'd need roughly 4900 elements in a list, each of which
will have a pointer to the next state (hopefully just one byte) and a
probability measure (also probably one byte).  There's also a little
overhead for each character we emit.  So this is about 10k of data.
I'm not sure if it's that useful.

* Provide our own RNG.  Gather entropy from events.

* Sound

* Check that when the category is changed, the title updates too

* Click field captions to zoom in on that form

* Beaming

* Implement our own encryption algorithm

So we can run on PalmOS2.

Perhaps build a separate version of the app, so that people who have
OS3 or later don't need to waste memory storing it.

* Optionally check for password when entering the app, rather than when opening a key
* Relock on power-on

Option in the preferences dialog to do this, I think.

* Attack tree
Fill it out with more possible attacks.

* Setting initial password

** Require set password on first run
This is the current behaviour, but is it the best?  

** Default to empty
But then people might not realize they have to set a password.  This
would seem to encourage insecure behaviour. 

** Require set password when creating first record
Would this perhaps be a bit more friendly?

* Button in list form to forget the password
Useful?  Mutt has this.

* Support categories, and store in appinfo
I think there's a standard format for this.  We might have to change
the appinfo from our current usage: perhaps the key information goes
into some other location.  It'd be a shame to change it rather than
just adding to it.

* Different security settings and passwords per category
... but if we do this perhaps we really want separate databases?

* Script to decode records on PC

* Use exceptions for error handling?

* Soft arrows to flip through records

Nah, not required.  It's easy enough to use the hardbuttons or to flip
back to the list form.

* PC conduit

GNOME-pilot or JPilot? 

On the flip side, it may be better *not* to offer this function: the
security issues to do with opening this information on the PC are very
scary.  PCs can be broken across the network, and a GUI module can
never be audited properly.

So on the whole I am inclined _not_ to implement this.

* Lost passwords

What can we offer people?  The best is probably a warning as they set
their password that lost passwords cannot be recovered.

If people do lose their password we should offer the choice to delete
all records.  If they use the app launcher's "Delete" function then
they lose the Keyring application as well as their data.

* Hint for forgotten passwords

Set when setting password, display from password dialog.

* Keep example databases from various releases to test compatibility

* Support multiple databases

I think this is more important than having multiple categories in a
single database, because we can only specify which database to hotsync
and people are likely to want to classify databases according to
different security requirements.

Do this instead of categories??

* Is there any useful way to support PalmOS global Find?
Just search public names?

* Zero-knowledge authentication

Use a handheld as a token that talks to a custom PAM module to
authenticate the user without ever typing a password.  One way to do
this would be to implement S/Key on the handheld, and somehow securely
get the seed onto the handheld. 

OPIE (one-time passwords everywhere) might be another good
alternative.

This is a little out of the scope of Keyring.

* If no password is set, don't encrypt or require password.
Really?  Yes, probably this would be good: better than decrypting on
the PC.

* Import memos

* How to load in long data?

* New version that does 0kp to authenticate to a custom PAM module.

  -- This really belongs in a separate program.


* Event loop timeout to show countdown?

Perhaps show a little open-lock icon while unlocked, and a closed-lock
while locked.  Perhaps clicking that icon ought to relock the keyring.

* GNOME-Pilot or JPilot conduit/module.

* Database info.  Multiple dbs?

* Check password timeout when paging?

** Wrong password
** Lock/unlock

* Perhaps re-sort records after returning to list, not on save?

* Better handling of error conditions
Especially out of memory.

* Store a password hint

* Reminder to change the password

for each record, put a reminder that it should be changed e.g. every N weeks.

* Resize edit form fields when text is entered, like the address book
