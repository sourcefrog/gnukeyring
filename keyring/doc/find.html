      <p>Can we usefully support PalmOS global find?  I guess we could
	just search the public names, but they're immediately visible
	in the list.</p>

      <p>Is the user ever going to want to search the private
	information?  Perhaps we could allow this only when they're
	still in the application and have it unlocked?</p>
