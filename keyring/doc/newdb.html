    <h1>New Keyring Database Format</h1>

    <p><tt>$Id$</tt></p>

    <p>
      I think it might be time to change the Keyring database format.
      Obviously we'll want to do this in a backward-compatible way.

    <h3>What's wrong?</h3>

    <p>
      Here are some potential reasons to change the structure.  Some
      may not actually require changing the database, but taken
      together it's probably time.

    <p>
      The foremost problem is that we encrypt all of the records with
      a hash of the password.  This is nice and simple, but
      potentially catastrophic while changing the password.  If
      anything goes wrong, then we'll be left with some passwords
      encrypted with the old key and some with the new key, and no way
      to recover them.  I guess one way around this would be to build
      a new database using the encryption key and store things in
      there.
      
    <p>
      Relying on the built-in DES routines was easy and makes it
      likely that the code is fast, but it's not ideal.  Since they're
      undocumented they may not actually be behaving properly,
      although they seem to be OK.  The routines aren't present in old
      versions of PalmOS, and since we don't have any other reason not
      to support those versions this is a little unfortunate.

    <p>
      On the other hand, the DES implementation hopefully uses
      assembler, and can be improved by Palm for future devices.
      There are more important features to add.

    <p>
      A stream cypher might be easier to use, but really blocks are
      fine.

    <p>One contender is <a

    <ul>
	<li>I want to support Categories.
	
        <li>The ``resizing record'' bug makes me suspicious of all
        that code.

    
      </ul>

    <h3>Backward Compatibility</h3>

    <p>
      PalmOS has a <tt>version</tt> field in the database header that
      can be used for these things.  At the moment this is set to
      0x42.  We could either leave all the code in there, or upgrade
      the first time we see a new database.  However we do this,
      remember to keep it simple!.
